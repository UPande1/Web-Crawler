# Web-Crawler
Simple Java crawler to crawl web pages on the same domain. If your page is redirected to another domain, that page is not picked up EXCEPT if it is the first URL tested. You can do this:

Crawl from a start point, defining the depth of the crawl, and decide to crawl only a specific path
Output: 1) The Page Title
        2) The Page URLs
        3) The Page Text
        
I have connected the MySQL database to create a table for all the output.


Experimental support for verifying that assets on a page work
